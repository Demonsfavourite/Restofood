# Restofood: Simple Ecommerce Website.

- Restofood is a simple ecommerce website with some basic functionalities. I was so curious, fantasize of what I can do using localstorage and because of that restofood is created. I know this is very basic compared to the pros out there but I'm not a pro, I'm still a student and a self-taught one.

# Functionalities:
 -<b>Basic Calculation.</b>
 -<b>Persist Add To Cart.</b>
 -<b>Removable add to cart items.</b>

 -<b>Order now is just a prop. It doesn't have any functionality. I haven't learned the payment gateway yet.</b>
